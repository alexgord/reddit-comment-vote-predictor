        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            Write some text in the input above, then hit the "predict" button. 
            My neural network will predict how many votes this comment would get 
            on reddit. This prediction will then be displayed above. For the moment 
            only plain text is supported.
        </p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            A neural network was fed thousands of top-level comments from reddit's 
            most popular subreddits, todayilearned, worldnews, science, pics, gaming, 
            IAmA, and videos. The neural network was trained to predict the number of 
            votes a comment would get.
